# Data-Masking-Anonymize
Pseudonymization:
Pseudonym means ‘false name’ in Greek, and a famous example is the fictional character Bruce Wayne, who sometimes goes by the name Batman. Similar to Bruce Wayne and Batman, pseudonymization in IT systems means that you mask the registered and their personal data.

In GDPR, pseudonymisation is defined as ”the processing of personal data in such a way that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information.” Personal data is thus exchanged with non-identifying data, and additional information is needed to recreate the original data. Further, the additional information should be kept separately.

Pseudonymization makes the information such as personal identification numbers and personal data less accessible to unauthorized users, and is a way to comply with GDPR requirements.

Anonymization:
Anonymized data refers to data that is made anonymous in such a way that the registered can no longer be identified. You simply remove the possibilities of identifying a person, and no additional information can restore the original information. Anonymization is difficult. You completely lose the connection between data and the individual. Nevertheless, it can be a beneficial technique when the data is used for statistical or research purposes.

As you may gather, there is a clear distinction between the two concepts. Pseudonymization means that an individual can still be identified through indirect or additional information. This means that pseudonymized personal data is still in scope. Anonymization means that you cannot restore the original information, and such data is out of scope of the GDPR.

What is Data Anonymization?
Data anonymization is a method of information sanitization, which involves removing or encrypting personally identifiable data in a dataset. The goal is to ensure the privacy of the subject’s information. Data anonymization minimizes the risk of information leaks when data is moving across boundaries. It also maintains the structure of the data, enabling analytics post-anonymization.

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands the pseudonymization or anonymization of stored information of individuals living in the EU. Anonymized data sets are not classified as personal data, and so are not subject to the rules of GDPR. This permits organizations to use the information for broader purposes while remaining compliant and protecting the rights of the data subjects. 

Data anonymization is also a core component of HIPAA requirements. HIPAA is a US regulation governing the use of Private Health Information (PHI) in the healthcare industry and its partners.
